libgphoto2 2.4.0

Build:
   * Non-recursive camlib build: Makes "make -j2" useful.
     "./configure --with-drivers=..." still works. Selective camlib
     rebuild is "make -C camlibs agfa_cl20.la" now. Selective camlib
     install is "make DRIVERS='canon.la ptp2.la' install-drivers".
   * Fix sierra and canon drivers picking up old gphoto2 headers.
   * libiconv linking fix for PTP2 driver.
   * Require external libltdl.

     On cameras not supporting it returns GP_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED.

   * Enhanced Bayer algorithm added globally.

Package / System integration:
   * New syntax for print-camera-list's udev output. See help output.

     Use "version pre-0.98" on the commandline to generate the old version.

   * Add new permission setup binary doing Microsoft OS Descriptor
     retrieval for MTP devices not explicitly listed.
     This binary (check-mtp-device) is used by the generated UDEV rules.
     (Not working currently since udev does not create the device before
     calling it.)

disk port:
   * handle automounter properly.

directory driver:
   * ignore anything not starting by '.' because it is not DCF compliant
     and it is used for things like Trash of metadata...

   * Add new permission setup script doing class based matching for
     PTP class cameras not listed explicitly by USB IDs.
     This script (check-ptp-camera) is used by the generated UDEV rules.

     Example usage:
	 print-camera-list udev-rules mode 660 group plugdev \
              > /etc/udev/rules.d/90-libgphoto2.rules

     or similar and set udevscriptdir='/lib/udev' at configure time or adjust
     the path to check-ptp-camera in the generated /etc/udev/rules.d/90-libgpoto2.rules
     file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

libgphoto2 2.2.1

   * Fix build for FreeBSD users (and other non-Linux)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

libgphoto2 2.2.0


Build system (packagers beware!):

   * You should generate HAL FDI, linux-hotplug usb.usermap, and udev rules
     now via our program:

 	  ${libdir}/print-camera-list (hal-fdi|usb-usermap|udev-rules)

     During a chrooted build you can use:
	CAMLIBS=$BUILDROOT/usr/lib/libgphoto2/2.2/ print-camera-list hal-fdi

     This obsoletes print-usb-usermap and print-udev-rules.

     The hal FDI file should be put into:
	/usr/share/hal/fdi/information/20thirdparty/10-camera-libgphoto2.fdi

     If you need to generate different stuff based on the cameras, please add
     it to the "print-camera-list" helper.

   * Added C# (csharp) bindings

     Thanks to Patrick van Staveren <trick@vanstaveren.us>'s initiative,
     we now compile, ship and install the C# bindings. However, a few
     things will still change about it, so don't just completely rely on
     it, its file names and locations, etc. just yet.


Client programmers (KDE, GNOME, MONO, C....) with specific character
set requirements:

   * We added new function gp_message_codeset(const char*) to API.
      - If you do not call this function, libgphoto2 will give you its
        messages in the codeset defined by the system locale.
	(The system locale is defined by the LANG, LANGUAGE, and LC_*
	environment variables.)
      - Call this function with your desired codeset if you require
        libgphoto2 messages in a fixed codeset independent from the
        system locale. For example, GTK+ applications always expect UTF-8.
      - gp_message_codeset() propagates the requested charset to
        libgphoto2_port and then calls gettext's bind_textdomain_codeset()
        function.
    * Added gp_camera_wait_for_event() API, to wait for
      specific camera events and return them to the caller.


libgphoto2 changes:

   * libgphoto DSO version is now 2.1.0

   * Lots of bugs were fixed.

   * New translations were added.

Driver changes:

   * PTP

     - PTP/IP support has been added.

     - On selected Nikon and Canon cameras it is now possible to capture
       images into the Camera SDRAM and in turn downloading it to libgphoto2
       internal storage, bypassing the memory card.

       To enable it, use the "capturetarget" setting, also saved in
       .gphoto/settings.

       This is useful for:
	   gphoto2 --capture-image -f /store_00010001 -p capt0000.jpg

       Or use the timelapse capture of gphoto2:
	   gphoto2 --capture-image -F <total frames> -I <seconds interval>

       Or write your own client using libgphoto2...


     - Support of MTP devices has been greatly enhanced.

       + Creative Zen devices now work.
       + iRiver devices work, but have some protocol subtleties / flaws.

       + Object Property (Meta Data) support now works in a basic way.

	   GP_FILE_TYPE_METADATA type get and put can be used to retrieve
	   and set meta data for files.

	   get: Returns all available properties and their contents.

	   put: Set the properties found in the file to the specified content.
		The non-listed are untouched.

	   The metadata looks like:
		   <Artist>Elvis Presley</Artist>

	   gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/Folder... --get-metadata file.mp3 --stdout > meta_file.mp3
	   ... edit meta_file.mp3 ...
	   gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/Folder... --upload-metadata meta_file.mp3

	   gphoto2 --get-all-metadata	... retrieves metadata of all files, with meta_ prefix.

       - Better --summary output, listing also Storage Devices and Device abilities.

       - Lots of new device ids.
         * Canon 5D, 30D, A340, A700, S40, S80
	 * Nikon D200
         * Casio EX-Z120
         * Kodak C360, Z700
         * HP M317
	 * Panasonic DMC-LC1
         * Fuji E900

     * Added MTP devices (mp3 players)
     * Some iRiver MTP devices (mp3/ogg players) are supported too,
       but are experimental.

       While the "Creative Zen Micro" is also an MTP device, we were
       not able yet to decipher the PTP protocol deviation.

       In general, MTP devices can be supported here, but you need
       to add the ID in camlibs/ptp2/library.c directly, since they
       do not have a USB class id.

     * Now supports a "fast filesystem" mode on newer Nikon PTP cameras.
     
       This speeds up initialisation notably on cameras with lots (>50)
       of images.

       However, this mode does not find the special files on the camera
       (AUTPRNT.MRK). It also cannot represent the correct directory
       structure.

       For normal users (who just download and process the images) the
       "fast" mode is recommended.

       It can be toggled in the "Camera Settings" menu and ~/.gphoto/settings.
