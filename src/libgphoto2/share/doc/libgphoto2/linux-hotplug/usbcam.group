# Sets up newly plugged in USB camera so that only members of the 
# group

GROUP=camera

# can access it from user space. (Replace camera with the name of the
# group you want to have access to the cameras.)
#
# Note that for this script to work, you'll need all of the following:
# a) a line in the file /etc/hotplug/usermap that corresponds to the 
#    camera you are using. You can get the correct lines for all cameras 
#    supported by libgphoto2 by running
#              $ print-camera-list usb-usermap usbcam
# b) a group "camera" where all users allowed access to the
#    camera are listed
# c) a Linux kernel supporting hotplug and usbdevfs
# d) the hotplug package (http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/)
#
# In the usermap file, the first field "usb module" should be named 
# "usbcam" like this script.
