# Sets up newly plugged in USB camera so that just one certain user

USER=root

# can access it from user space. (Replace root by the user you want
# to have access to the cameras.)

# It then runs the X11 application (gtkam is used as an example)

X11_APP=/usr/bin/gtkam

# on the X11 display (:0 should work on most single user workstations)

DISPLAY=:0

# in the directory (~$USER is just the user's home directory)

# Note that for this script to work, you'll need all of the following:
# a) a line in the file /etc/hotplug/usermap that corresponds to the 
#    camera you are using. You can get the correct lines for all cameras 
#    supported by libgphoto2 by running
#              $ print-camera-list usb-usermap usbcam
# b) run your camera software as the user given above
# c) a Linux kernel supporting hotplug and usbdevfs
# d) the hotplug package (http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/)
# e) su
# f) env
# g) X11
#
# In the usermap file, the first field "usb module" should be named 
# "usbcam" like this script.
