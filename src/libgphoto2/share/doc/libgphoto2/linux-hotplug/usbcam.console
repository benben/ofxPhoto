# Sets up newly plugged in USB camera so that the user who owns
# the console according to pam_console can access it from user space
#
# Note that for this script to work, you'll need all of the following:
# a) a line in the file /etc/hotplug/usermap that corresponds to the 
#    camera you are using. You can get the correct lines for all cameras 
#    supported by libgphoto2 by running
#              $ print-camera-list usb-usermap usbcam
# b) a setup using pam_console creates the respective lock files
#    containing the name of the respective user. You can check for that
#    by executing "echo `cat /var/{run,lock}/console.lock`" and 
#    verifying the appropriate user is mentioned somewhere there.
# c) a Linux kernel supporting hotplug and usbdevfs
# d) the hotplug package (http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/)
#
# In the usermap file, the first field "usb module" should be named 
# "usbcam" like this script.

    # This also works with non-gdm logins (e.g. on a virtual terminal)
