On 08/23/2007, I discovered a new camera with USB ID 0x2770:0x913d. The
basic functions of this camera are the same as those of the 0x2770:0x905c
cameras which are the main ones supported in libgphoto2/camlibs/digigr8, but
there are some small differences. For a complete description and discussion
of the 0x2770:0x913D camera, therefore, the reader should also read 
README.905C. Only the basic features and differences with the 
previously-supported 0x2770:0x905C cameras are listed here:

Features of the Suprema Digital Keychain Camera:

	-- 640x480 and 320x240 resolution settings
	-- supports gphoto2 --capture-preview option (presumed that the size
		of the output image can be adjusted in code, default
`		320x240; see README.905C for details of that.
	-- apparently does _not_ support multiframe AVI capability, or if so
		it is not mentioned in the written manual. 
	-- a setting does exist for shooting three frames with one shutter
		press, but three only, not more. 
	-- has a viewfinder and preview window on the back, which is very
		pretty but presumably eats battery. 
	-- saves photos in volatile SDRAM, so don't let the batteries die. 
	-- permits deletion of individual photos on the camera, by pushing
		some buttons. This feature is not present on the SQ905C 
		cameras and is a big difference. Because of the way 
		this deletion is done, the function which counts photos 
		needed a serious rewrite to accommodate the deletion.
		It will probably not ever be possible, unfortunately, to
		support deletion of any photos or images on the camera, by
		means of software control from the computer.
	-- webcam functionality. The webcam function is obviously
		supportable (gphoto2 --capture-image uses it to shoot one
		frame), but libgphoto2 does not do webcams, so that can't be
		done here. 

As a further note, the gphoto2 --capture-image USB command when used with an
0x2770:0x913D camera will _not_ delete the images already on the camera. This 
means one does not have to worry about that happening; it also means that there
is no way known to implement the gphoto2 -D option for these cameras. 


On 10/13/07 I discovered that the Sakar Styleshot (Sakar ID no. 28290 or 28292) 
is also supported, and I have added it to the list of cameras in library.c. 
Aside from appearance, the main difference between the Styleshot and the 
Suprema described above is that the Styleshot has an internal rechargeable 
battery. 

On 12/23/07 the Sakar Spiderman (no. 92045) has been reported by Martin Laberge 
<mlsoft@videotron.ca>. THERE IS POTENTIAL NAME CONFUSION WITH THIS CAMERA. The
Sakar Amazing Spiderman (no. 94044) has in it a JL2005C chip which is currently
not supported in libgphoto2. Buyer beware!

PLEASE TEST THE STANDALONE RAW PHOTO CONVERTER/DISPLAYER

An experimental program for processing raw files into finished photos is
available now, in gphoto2/trunk/playground/raw_converters/sq_raw_converter
Please try this program. If the results are good, I will incorporate the
routines used there directly into libgphot02/camlibs/digigr8. I like the
results, but they need testing.


WARRANTY: 

None. For a more complete discussion of this issue, the reader is referred to 
README.905C and to the statements of the LGPL license regarding warranty.
