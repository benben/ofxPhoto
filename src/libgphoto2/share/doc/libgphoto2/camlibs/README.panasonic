Overview 
--------

	This  directory  contains  Panasonic   PV-DC1000  and  PV-DC1580  gPhoto
	libraries.  In Europe, these models are known as NV-DC1000 and NV-DC1580
	respectively.  To avoid confusion we simply write DC1000 and DC1580.

	Both libraries are based on dc1000 utility,  written by Fredrik  Roubert
	and Galen Brooks.  Despite  similarities in the two protocols  there are
	two separate libraries, for DC1000 and DC1580 models respectively.
	
	From the source code of Michael  McCormack's  Nikon  CoolPix 600 library
	for  gPhoto1  it  follows  that  DC1580  and  Nikon  CP 600 use the same
	protocol.  As of 28-th  July,  there are no reports if this Nikon  model
	works or not with DC1580 library.
