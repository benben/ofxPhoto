CONCERNING 0x2770:0x9050 CAMERAS:

As of 01/20/2008, the only known camera with this USB ID string is the 
"Disney pix micro," found at KB Toys. Its functionality is very basic. On the 
package it says the camera is able to take 20 photos, but in fact the number 
of photos is variable. For, they are all compressed. 

Since the compression algorithm is the same as that in the 0x905C cameras, this  
camera is quite usable, for what it is. Resolution for this camera is fixed at 
352x288 and can not be adjusted. In fact, the only thing on the camera which 
can be controlled at all, aside from snapping photos one at a time, is to 
delete photos one at a time or to delete all.  To delete one photo with the 
delete button on the camera, press the button. To delete all, hold it down 
longer. To the best of my ability to determine, the camera has no clip option, 
no delayed-shooting option, and no multi-frame clips intended for AVI images. 
However, the camera will do software deletion of all photos using the option 
gphoto2 -D, while for the other cameras supported in camlibs/digigr8 the 
gphoto2 -D option does nothing at all and is therefore considered as an 
unsupported operation for those other cameras. However:

The USB command to delete is the same as the command to shoot a frame 
(gphoto2 option is --capture-preview). If you shoot a frame with the Disney 
pix micro, it will delete whatever photos are on the camera !!!


PLEASE TEST THE STANDALONE RAW PHOTO CONVERTER/DISPLAYER

An experimental program for processing raw files into finished photos is
available now, in gphoto2/trunk/playground/raw_converters/sq_raw_converter
Please try this program. If the results are good, I will incorporate the
routines used there directly into libgphot02/camlibs/digigr8. I like the
results, but they need testing.
