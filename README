ofxPhoto (libgphoto2)

This addon uses the gphoto2 library to take pictures remotely
from your camera and use it directly in openFrameworks.

See http://www.openframeworks.cc/ and http://www.gphoto.org/ for
more Information.

* Is my camera supported?

First check here if your camera is on this list: http://gphoto.org/doc/remote/
After this install gphoto2 for example (on ubuntu) with

sudo apt-get install gphoto2

and test if your camera works with this command

gphoto2 --capture-image-and-download

If this works for you, the addon should work too.

* Install Instructions

This only works on Linux 64bit for now. I've tested it with Ubuntu 9.10 64bit
and a Canon IXUS II and a Canon G7.

Download the addon from here: http://github.com/benben/ofxPhoto/downloads
Or fork it from here: http://github.com/benben/ofxPhoto
Copy the addon in the addons folder and the example in your apps folder.

* Basic Usage

Plug in your camera and turn it on.
A splash screen should appear where you have to unmount the camera from the system.
Launch the photoExample, press Spacebar and watch the Console.
After a few seconds a picture should appear on the screen.
If the addon doesn't work, but the gphoto2 capture command above, please report it.

* Other

Please test it, if you can!
